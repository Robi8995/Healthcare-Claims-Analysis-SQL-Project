## üéØ Project Objective

**Objective:** Assess healthcare claims portfolio, identify high-risk patients, detect fraud patterns, and analyze provider performance to minimize fraudulent claims and optimize reimbursement strategies.

**Database:** `Healthcare_Claims_Project` | **Industry:** Healthcare & Insurance

**Problem Statement:**  
Healthcare insurers face portfolio risk from fraudulent claims, high-cost patients, and inconsistent provider performance, leading to financial losses and operational inefficiencies. This project provides data-driven risk assessment, fraud detection systems, and provider performance analysis to minimize claim losses and optimize healthcare spending.
